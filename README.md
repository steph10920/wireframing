## Wireframing

### What is Wireframing?

Wireframing is a visual representation of a user interface that outlines the structure and layout of a page or screen. It is typically created in the early stages of the design process to plan the basic framework and functionality of an application or website before adding visual design elements or writing code.

Wireframes are usually low-fidelity sketches or diagrams that focus on placement of elements such as navigation menus, buttons, content areas, and forms. They help teams and stakeholders visualize how users will interact with the product.

### Importance of Wireframing in the Design Process

Wireframing plays a crucial role in the design and development process for several reasons:

- **Clarity:** It helps communicate ideas clearly and aligns team members on layout and functionality.
- **Efficiency:** Allows for quick changes and iterations before any code is written or high-fidelity designs are developed.
- **User-Centered Design:** Encourages focusing on user needs and interactions early in the project.
- **Feedback:** Provides a simple way to gather input from stakeholders and users, reducing the risk of costly revisions later on.
- **Foundation:** Serves as a blueprint that guides designers and developers throughout the implementation process.

By incorporating wireframes into the planning stage, teams can ensure a more user-friendly, functional, and cohesive product design.
## Types of Wireframes

Wireframes come in different levels of detail, each serving a specific purpose in the design process. The two most common types are **low-fidelity** and **high-fidelity** wireframes.

### Low-Fidelity Wireframes

Low-fidelity wireframes are simple, often hand-drawn or digitally sketched representations of a layout. They focus on basic structure and content placement without delving into visual design details such as colors, fonts, or images.

**When to Use:**
- During the early stages of design
- For brainstorming and quick iterations
- To communicate layout ideas and user flows with stakeholders

**Key Characteristics:**
- Black and white or grayscale
- Placeholder elements (e.g., boxes for images, “lorem ipsum” text)
- Emphasis on structure over aesthetics

### High-Fidelity Wireframes

High-fidelity wireframes are more detailed and closely resemble the final product. They may include actual text content, typography, icons, spacing, and even color schemes.

**When to Use:**
- In later stages of design
- For usability testing and client presentations
- To hand off to developers as part of design specifications

**Key Characteristics:**
- Detailed layout with accurate spacing and proportions
- Real or representative content
- Closer to the final look and feel of the application

## Wireframe Example Explanation

### What Type of Wireframe Is This?


This wireframe is a **High-Fidelity** wireframe.

**Reason:**  
It shows basic layout without visual design details / detailed design with typography and spacing, making it appropriate for early ideation / development handoff or usability testing.
