## Wireframing

### What is Wireframing?

Wireframing is a visual representation of a user interface that outlines the structure and layout of a page or screen. It is typically created in the early stages of the design process to plan the basic framework and functionality of an application or website before adding visual design elements or writing code.

Wireframes are usually low-fidelity sketches or diagrams that focus on placement of elements such as navigation menus, buttons, content areas, and forms. They help teams and stakeholders visualize how users will interact with the product.

### Importance of Wireframing in the Design Process

Wireframing plays a crucial role in the design and development process for several reasons:

- **Clarity:** It helps communicate ideas clearly and aligns team members on layout and functionality.
- **Efficiency:** Allows for quick changes and iterations before any code is written or high-fidelity designs are developed.
- **User-Centered Design:** Encourages focusing on user needs and interactions early in the project.
- **Feedback:** Provides a simple way to gather input from stakeholders and users, reducing the risk of costly revisions later on.
- **Foundation:** Serves as a blueprint that guides designers and developers throughout the implementation process.

By incorporating wireframes into the planning stage, teams can ensure a more user-friendly, functional, and cohesive product design.
